# CwwOnline.TabbedPageExt.Xamarin

A TabbedPage for Xamarin Forms which supports:
* **UI virtualization**: Tab pages can either directly be created (before they are selected) or they can be created at the moment the tab is selected.
* **Crossplatform 'More' view**: For all platforms (android, iOS, uwp, ..) a 'more' tabbar button (iOS) or toolbar button (android, uwp) is automatically inserted poping up a iOS-like "More" view to select one of the 'hidden' pages.
* **Navigation support**: Possibility to push the TabbedPage itself on the navigation stack.
